Details:
-outlier removal: remove first and last lap (unless it is the last lap of the race) [this is not working correctly]
	-then, do comparison with averages of 3 previous laps
	-outlier removal could be improved further

-rain: no rain = 0, light = 1, medium = 2, heavy = 3

Try:
-publish release on github (when ready)

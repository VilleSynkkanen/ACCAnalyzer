Features:
-analysis for each stint (done)
	-pace graph, average lap time, exclude laps above a threshold 
	-histogram of lap times 
	-starting/ending fuel
	-lap time standard deviation 
	-same for sector times 
	-excluded lap numbers 
	-laps
	-conditions: track grip, rain, tyre used 
	-temps: in conditions graph, air and road 
-overall race analysis (done)
	-position graph (also including other drivers)
	-gap behind graph
	-laps for each driver
-save analysis to a pdf file (done)
-configurable options via an ini file (delimiter, plot dpi, driver ID, data dir, image dir, output dir)
-command line arguments (data file name, comparison lap count, outlier margin, fit degree)

TODO:
-improvements
	-temperature plotting is not working correctly
	-limit number of ticks in plots
	-page formatting (stint info into a table)
	-outlier removal improvement (average of following and previous laps)
	-deal with special letters
		-maybe have driver recognition with (also) name if it can be reasonably implemented
-error handling
	-dealing with broken data, etc.
	-should work even with broken sector data
	-fail analysis and show error message when something else goes wrong
-ini file for settings
-command line arguments
-first build with pyinstaller

FINALLY:
-code refactoring if necessary
-instructions for using the application
-github readme

Details:
-outlier removal: remove first and last lap (unless it is the last lap of the race) [this is not working correctly]
	-then, do comparison with averages of 3 previous laps
	-outlier removal could be improved further
-how to deal with special letters (ä, ö, etc.)?

Try:
-publish release on github (when ready)

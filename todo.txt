Features:
-analysis for each stint (done)
	-pace graph, average lap time, exclude laps above a threshold 
	-histogram of lap times 
	-starting/ending fuel
	-lap time standard deviation 
	-same for sector times 
	-excluded lap numbers 
	-laps
	-conditions: track grip, rain, tyre used 
	-temps: in conditions graph, air and road 
-overall race analysis (done)
	-position graph (also including other drivers)
	-gap behind graph
	-laps for each driver
-save analysis to a pdf file (done)
-configurable options via an ini file (delimiter, plot dpi, driver ID, data dir, image dir, output dir)
-command line arguments (data file name, comparison lap count, outlier margin, fit degree)

Notes:
-outlier margin: Keep between 0.005 and 0.05 (default value = 0.025). More variable conditions may require a larger value
-fit degree should be 2 most of the time, maybe sometimes 3 or even 4

TODO:
-error handling
	-dealing with broken data, etc.
	-should work even with broken sector data
		-if one sector is missing, calculate times from the other sectors and the full lap
		-otherwise fail the analysis
	-fail analysis and show error message when something else goes wrong
-first build with pyinstaller

FINALLY:
-instructions for using the application
-github readme

Details:
-how to deal with special letters (ä, ö, etc.)?
-Write "PS. Ben Crook sucks" at the end of the instructions

Try:
-publish release on github (when ready)

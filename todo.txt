Features (done):
-analysis for each stint
	-pace graph, average lap time, exclude laps above a threshold 
	-histogram of lap times 
	-starting/ending fuel
	-lap time standard deviation 
	-same for sector times 
	-excluded lap numbers 
	-laps
	-conditions: track grip, rain, tyre used 
	-temps: in conditions graph, air and road 
-overall race analysis
	-position graph (also including other drivers)
	-gap behind graph
	-laps for each driver
-save analysis to a pdf file
-configurable options via an ini file (delimiter, plot dpi, driver ID)
-command line arguments (data file name, comparison lap count, outlier margin, fit degree)

Notes:
-outlier margin: Keep between 0.005 and 0.05 (default value = 0.025). More variable conditions may require a larger value
-fit degree should be 2 most of the time, maybe sometimes 3 or even 4

TODO:
-github readme
-publish release on github (when ready)

Known issues & limitations:
-First lap gets removed if starting fuel is zero in the data
-Analysis may fail if a stint only has an outlap
-Starting fuel is actually the fuel after lap 1 (actual starting value is not available)
